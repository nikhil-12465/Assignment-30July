Aim:-

We are given an array of n consecutive numbers and we have to find the one which is missing from it .
condition:-
 Without using any addition , subtraction, multiplication, division.
 We are given that we have decimal,binary, hexadecimalÂ representation.


 algorithm:-

 1 : initially we take input of no of element in array with missing element
 2 : then create a vector of n-1 element ( in which missing element is absent )
 3 : then we create a function missingelement(vector<int> &a,int n) which return integer value
 4 : here we initialize ans=0;
 5 : after that  we are taking xor of ans with all the element of a vector
 6 : calculate min element of the array and store in startele then calculate lastele also
 7 : after that another for loop :-
        for(i=firstele  to  lastele){
               ans=ans^i;}
 8 : then this function return the value of missing element
