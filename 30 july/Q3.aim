Aim:-
find the a ratio to power n but the iteration should be less than n.

algorithm:-

1- initially we have to get user input of base and power then make a function to calculate power .
2- during the power calculation  we can make a variable which caalculate power(base,n/2)
3- at last we make diffrent conditions on even ,odd and when power is 0  for solving these problem and return power
