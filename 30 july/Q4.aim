Aim:-

 Make an array b from the given array a of the same size from 1 to n such that b[i]
 contains the product of element of a[i] but not the element present at that index.
  
algorithm:-

1-initially we took user input of an array a[n].
2- make for loop from j=0 to n and nested for loop for i=0 to n.
3-here we put the condition (j!=i) and calculate the value of b[j] by creating a variable using multiplication of elements
