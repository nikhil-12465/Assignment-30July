/* Aim = In this question we have given the coordinate (x,y)
  in which x is shown with the help of the x-axis and y is shown with the help of some values of the given array , a[i]  . 
  Now we have to find the maximum volume occupied by the container formed with the edges.
  In which the first edge is formed with the help of (x,0)and (x,a[i]) while the other edge is formed with the help of (m,0) and (m, a[j]).
  where x,m are the points on the x-axis and i,j are the indexes of the array.  */
