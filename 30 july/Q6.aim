Aim:-

We are given that a ball is falling on the ground with velocity v and at each bounce its velocity decreases by half, 
Then find the number of bounces.

algorithm:-

1- initially take user input of velocity .
2- iterate while loop until v!=0 and reduce the velocity by v/2 in each iterations.
3- use a variable outside the the loop which intialize with 1 and increase its value by 1 in each itrations .
