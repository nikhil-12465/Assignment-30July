Aim of the Code:
The aim of this code is to measure the time taken for a specific operation on arrays of varying sizes, starting from 50 and increasing by a factor of 10 until reaching 500 million. However, the current implementation does not include a meaningful search or any relevant operation on the array elements.

Working Algorithm:

Loop Over Array Sizes:

The code initializes the array size to 50 and enters a loop that continues until the array size reaches 500 million.
In each iteration, the size is multiplied by 10.

Array Declaration:

An array arr of the current size is declared, but it is not initialized or populated with any values.

Array Operation:

A loop is intended to perform some operation on the elements of the array. Specifically, it checks if arr[i] is equal to arr[0] for each index i in the array.
Since the array is not initialized, this comparison does not yield useful results.


Time Measurement:

The time taken for the loop (which currently does not perform any meaningful operation) is measured using high_resolution_clock.
The duration (in nanoseconds) is printed along with the corresponding array size.
