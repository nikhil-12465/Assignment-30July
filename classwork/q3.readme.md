Aim of the Code:
The aim of the provided code is to perform a binary search on a sorted array to determine if a specified number exists within that array. The code includes two implementations: one using an iterative approach and another using recursion.

Working Algorithm:


Iterative Approach:

Input: The user is prompted to enter the number of elements n in the array.
Array Initialization: An array a of size n is created, and each element is assigned a random value between 0 and p (10).
Sorting: The array is sorted using the sort() function from the <algorithm> library.
User Input for Search: The user is prompted to enter the number x they want to search for in the array.
Binary Search Logic:
The search is performed using a while loop, maintaining low and high indices.
The midpoint mid is calculated, and the element at this index is compared to x.
If the element is found, its index is printed.
If the element at mid is greater than x, the high index is updated; otherwise, the low index is updated.
Output: The result is printed based on whether the element was found.


Recursive Approach:

Input: Similar to the iterative approach, the user inputs the number of elements and fills the array with user-provided values.
Sorting: The array is sorted before performing the search.
User Input for Search: The user is prompted to enter the number x to search for.
Recursive Binary Search Function:
The function binary_search() is defined to take the array, current low and high indices, and the number x as parameters.
It uses recursion to narrow down the search range.
If a[mid] equals x, the function returns 1 (indicating success).
If x is greater than a[mid], the search continues in the upper half; otherwise, it continues in the lower half.
If the number is not found, the function returns 0.
Output: After the function call, it prints whether the number was found.
