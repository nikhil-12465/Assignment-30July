Aim of the Code:
The provided code implements a linear search algorithm to find an element in an array. It uses recursion to search through the elements of the array and returns the index of the found element or indicates that the element is not found.


Working Algorithm:

Input the Number of Elements:

The user is prompted to enter the number of elements (n) in the array.

Generate Random Elements:

The program fills an array a with n random integers, each ranging from 0 to 19 (since N is set to 20).

Display the Array:

The randomly generated array elements are printed to the console.

Input the Search Element:

The user is asked to input a number (x) that they want to search for in the array.

Linear Search Implementation:

The function linearsearch is called, which performs a recursive linear search:
If the index i exceeds n, it returns -1 to indicate the element is not found.
If the element at index i equals x, it returns the index i.
If neither condition is met, it recursively calls itself with the next index (i + 1).

Output the Result:

Based on the result of the search, the program prints the index of the found element or indicates that the element was not found.
