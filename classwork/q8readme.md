Aim
To create a program that evaluates a polynomial using its coefficients, allows for displaying the polynomial in standard form, and computes the value of the polynomial at a given input.

Working
Input Polynomial Degree and Coefficients: The user specifies the degree of the polynomial and enters the coefficients.
Display Polynomial: The polynomial is displayed in standard form.
Evaluate Polynomial: The user inputs a value for x, and the program evaluates the polynomial at that point.
