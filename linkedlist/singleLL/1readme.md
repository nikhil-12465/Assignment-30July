Aim
To implement a singly linked list that supports creation, updating, deletion, reversal, and sorting of nodes, allowing for efficient manipulation of the list.


Working

Node Structure:

Each node contains two elements:
A value (data) that holds the information.
A pointer to the next node (next).

List Creation:

A new singly linked list is created by initializing the head pointer to nullptr.
Nodes are dynamically allocated when added to the list.

Insertion:

At the Beginning: A new node is created, its next pointer points to the current head, and the head pointer is updated to the new node.
At the End: Traverse to the last node (where next is nullptr), and link the new node's next pointer to nullptr.
At a Specific Position: Traverse to the desired position, adjust the next pointers of the nodes around the insertion point to include the new node.

Updating:

To update a node, traverse the list to find the node with the desired value. Once found, modify the node's value.

Deletion:

To delete a node:
If it’s the head node, update the head pointer to the next node.
If it’s a middle or end node, traverse the list to find the previous node and adjust its next pointer to bypass the node to be deleted. Then, deallocate the memory for the deleted node.

Reversal:

To reverse the list, maintain three pointers: prev, current, and next. Iterate through the list, updating the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node, effectively reversing the direction of the list.

Sorting:

To sort the linked list, use a sorting algorithm (like Bubble Sort or Merge Sort) that traverses the list and rearranges the nodes based on their values. Since it's a singly linked list, this will involve rearranging the next pointers.
